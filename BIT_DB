## 1. How many orders were placed in January? - 9681
## We counted the number of orderID's in the JanSales table but knew that there were some data that was incomplete. To get a true number of sales, we 
## filtered out any OrderID that was longer than 6 characters or where it has 'Order ID' inside the OrderID colmn. We could have have dropped the AND 
## statement as 'Order ID' is more than 6 characters but through it good to add as an example. 

SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

## 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? - 379
## We carried out a count on the amount of orderID's where the Product colmn matched "iPhone". We opted to also display the Product name but this can be 
## removed by removing Product from the initial SELECT statement.

SELECT COUNT(orderID), Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND Product = "iPhone";

## 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
## We used a LEFT OUTER JOIN to aggregate the Customers and FebSales tables. We renamed each table for ease of use 

SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers Customer
LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
ON Customer.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6;

## 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
