## 1. How many orders were placed in January? - 9681
## We counted the number of orderID's in the JanSales table but knew that there were some data that was incomplete. To get a true number of sales, we 
## filtered out any OrderID that was longer than 6 characters or where it has 'Order ID' inside the OrderID colmn. We could have have dropped the AND 
## statement as 'Order ID' is more than 6 characters but through it good to add as an example. 

SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

## 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? - 379
## We carried out a count on the amount of orderID's where the Product colmn matched "iPhone". We opted to also display the Product name but this can be 
## removed by removing Product from the initial SELECT statement.

SELECT COUNT(orderID), Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND Product = "iPhone";

## 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
## We used a LEFT OUTER JOIN to aggregate the Customers and FebSales tables. We renamed each table for ease of use 

SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers Customer
LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
ON Customer.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6;

## 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? AAA Batteries (4 Pack) @ 2.99
## We selected both the Product and Price from the JanSales table but filtered it on Price by using the MIN operator to show the lowest number in the
## price colmn.

SELECT Product, 
MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product, Price;

## 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the 
## products).
## We used the GROUP BY operator to group each product while the SUM operator is used to calculate the total amount of products in each group. We then 
## multiply each groups quantity with its respective product price which gives us the product Revenue.

SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as Total_Revenue,
Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

## 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
## The first query that was ran provide us with all the products that were sold to the address in Feb. Used a wildcard with the address as the 
## initial search did produce any results.
## 2 x (4 Pack) AAA Batteries were ordered at a cost of 3.84 each

SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '548 Lincoln%';

##The question also asked what was the total Revenue for the property. Total Revenue for the property over Feb was 7.68. 

SELECT Quantity, Product,
SUM(Quantity)*price as Total_Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '548 Lincoln%'
GROUP BY Product;

## 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
## We joined the FebSales & Customer tables (on the orderID colmn of each) as we required the Customer Account Number (from Customers Table) and Quantity
## (from FebSales). TRo get the average spent, we took the quantity of products and multiplied it with the price which gave us the Average Spent. We 
## used the COUNT function to count all the unique customer account numbers. We specified set criteria as we did not want any records that did not have 
## an account number shorter or longer than 6 characters or if the recorded stated 'Order ID'. We also only wanted recordes where the Quantity was more
## than 2. The answer we received was 278 customers ordered more than 2 products with an average spent of 13.8279... We could have used the ROUND function 
## which would have given us 14 (As indicated on the example below)

select  
AVG(FebSales.Quantity*price) as avg_spent,
COUNT(distinct Customers.acctnum) AS Num_Of_Cust_Ordered_More_Than_2
FROM BIT_DB.customers Customers
LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
ON Customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(Customers.order_id) = 6 
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'
AND FebSales.Quantity > 2;

## Using ROUND Function

select  
ROUND(AVG(FebSales.Quantity*price)) as avg_spent,
COUNT(distinct Customers.acctnum) AS Num_Of_Cust_Ordered_More_Than_2
FROM BIT_DB.customers Customers
LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
ON Customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(Customers.order_id) = 6 
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'
AND FebSales.Quantity > 2;
