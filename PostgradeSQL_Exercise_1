## Example query (PostgreSQL)
## SELECT * FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people";

## Tips:
## (*) Table names containing punctuation, capitalization, or spaces should be
##     quoted, e.g. "Test Data.csv".
## (*) Add more data by using the Upload Data button.
## (*) Create additional schemas for namespacing your tables, e.g. "CREATE SCHEMA my_schema;".
## (*) When querying tables created outside of the public (default) schema,
##     be sure to specify the desired schema, e.g. "SELECT * FROM my_schema."my data.csv";".

## Test query to the database
SELECT * FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people";

## Joining two tables (renaminging each table) and carrying out a query on the data

SELECT
title.type,
people.cast,
title.title,
title.release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" title
ON people.show_id=title.show_id ;

##Count the amount of Movies in the database = 6131

SELECT
COUNT(title.type)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" title
WHERE type='Movie' ;

##Showing when the most recent batch of TV Shows or Movies have been added using ORDER BY and DESC operator

SELECT
title.date_added
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" title
ORDER BY title.date_added DESC;

## Or a diffrent way to solve the query is
##The previous output provided some rows that had no data and we needed to scroll further down to find the most recent date. The next query carries out a similar check but do not return any lines where there is no data and only gives us the MAX date in the table

SELECT
MAX(date(title.date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" title
ORDER BY title.date_added DESC;

## Sort the title colmn to show all TV Shows & Movies in Alphabetical order

SELECT
title.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" title
ORDER BY title.title ASC;

## Aggregated the two tables as data had relationship. Filtered the DB on the title of the movie to indicate who the director was Jane Campiom

SELECT
people.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" title
ON people.show_id=title.show_id
WHERE title.title = 'Bright Star';

## Finding the olders Movie by searching the Type colmn where it states "Movie" and sording it ASC. The year was 1942 and the movie was "The Battle of Midway" & "Prelude of War"

SELECT
title.title,
title.release_year,
title.type
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" title
WHERE title.type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY title.release_year ;
